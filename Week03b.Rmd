A 2014 Boston (Logan airport) flight data summary table will be used in this tutorial. The summary displays average (arithmetic mean) delay time (in minutes) by day of the work week and quarter. The following chunk of code recreates the data.

```{r tidy=FALSE}

df <- data.frame( Weekday = c( "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri" ),
                  Q1      = c(  9.9 ,  4.9	,  8.8 ,   12.2 ,  12.2 ),
                  Q2      = c(  5.4	,  9.7  , 11.1 ,   10.2 ,   8.1 ),
                  Q3      = c(  8.8 ,  7.9  , 10.2 ,   9.2  ,   7.9 ),
                  Q4      = c(  6.9 ,    5  ,  9.3 ,   9.7  ,   5.6 ) )
```



# Introduction

Reshaping a table involves modifying the layout (or changing the "shape") of a table. In our example, `df` is in a "wide" format.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df)
#pander::pandoc.table(df, justify = 'right')
#dplyr::tbl_df(df)
```

This format is what we are accustomed to when working in a spreadsheet environment; it's in a human "readable" structure where the two variables are split across rows (Quarters) and columns (day of week). The confluence of the two variables produce **values** (average delay times). But such a table format does not lend itself well to data analysis environments such as R. Most functions and graphic tools require that the tables with more than one variable (e.g. Quarter and Day-of-week) be in a "long" form where each variable is grouped in its own column and each value has its own row. This is not the case with our `df` table where the Day-of-week variable is split across 5 columns and each row has 5 values.

A package that facilitates converting from wide to long (and *vice versa*)  is `tidyr`. To go from wide to long, we use the `gather` function and from long to wide, we use the `spread` function.

# Creating a long table from a wide table

The `gather` function takes three arguments: 

 * `key=`: This is the name of the new column which will combine all values associated with the variable type associated with each column (e.g. `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` and `Q4`).
 * `value=`: This is the name of the new column which will list all values associated with a unique row and column variable (e.g. average delay times)
 * The third parameter does not have a name, but is a list of columns that are to be collapsed. The column can be referenced by column number or column name.
 
In our example, the line of code needed to re-express the table into a long form can be written in one of three ways:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
# or
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" ,  2:5           )
# or
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" ,  -Weekday      )
```

All three lines produce the same output, they differ only by how we are referencing the columns that are to be collapsed. Note that we assigned the names `Quarter` and `Delay` to the two new columns.

The first 10 lines of the output table are shown here. Note how each `Delay` value has its own row.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
head(df.l, 10)
```

The following figure summarises the wide to long conversion.

# Creating a wide table from a long table

If a table is to be used for a visual assessment of the values, a long format may be difficult to work with. A long table can be re-expressed into a wide form by picking the two variables that will define the new unique rows and columns. 

Continuing with our example, we will convert `df.l` back to a wide format.

```{r}
df.w <-  spread( df.l ,   key = Quarter  ,   value = Delay  ) 
```

We've now recreated the wide version of our table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
head(df.w, 10)
```

The following figure summarises the wide to long conversion.
