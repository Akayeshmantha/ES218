We can use `dplyr`'s join operations to join elelments from one table to another table. Four such functions are `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`, and `full join`.

To demonstrate these functions, we'll work off of two dataframes: `df` (the data frame we are joining to) and `dj` (the table being joined to `df`). 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

df <- data.frame( x = c(1, 23, 4, 43, 2, 17),
                  y = c("a", "b", "b", "b", "a", "d"))

dj <- data.frame( z = c("apple", "pear", "orange"),
                  y = c("a", "b", "c"))
```


# Left join

If a join element in `df` does not exist in `dj`, assign `NA` in the output column `z`. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
left_join(df, dj, by="y")
```

# Right join
If a join element in `df` does not exist in `dj`, remove that element from the output. Also note that all elements in `dj` appear in the output (even if they don't have a match in `df` in which case an `NA` value is added), and the order matches the order in which the `y` elements appear in `dj`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
right_join(df, dj, by="y")
```

# Inner join

If a join element in `df` does not exist in `dj`, remove that element from the ouput.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
inner_join(df, dj, by="y")
```

# Full join

If a join element in `df` does not exist in `dj`, assign `NA` in the output. Also note that all elements in `dj` appear in the output too (even if they don't have a match in `df` in which case an `NA` value is added).

```{r warning=FALSE}
full_join(df, dj, by="y")
```
