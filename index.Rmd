 * Getting a session'??s info 
 * A brief [video intro](Week1/RStudio_environ1.webm) to the RStudio environment 

## Some useful links 
  * For R programming questions, a wonderful (peer-reviewed) forum is http://stackoverflow.com/ (add the `[r]` label in the search box to limit the search to R related topics).
  * For statistical questions, search the http://stats.stackexchange.com forum (here too add the `[r]` label in the search box to limit the search to R related topics)
  * A very nice repository of R related blogs is http://R-bloggers.com (I check this daily!)
  * If you are on the Colby network, you can access the **Use R!**  online books series at http://link.springer.com/bookseries/6991
