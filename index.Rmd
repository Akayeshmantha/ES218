# Week 1  
## Course introduction [(lecture notes)](Week01.html) 
## Tools of the trade: [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
## [The R and R Studio environments](http://personal.colby.edu/personal/m/mgimond/RIntro/01_The_R_environment.html)
 * Command line vs. script file
 * Packages
     + Base packages
     + Installing packages from CRAN
     + Installing packages from GitHub
     + Using a package in a R session
 * Getting a session's info 
 * A brief [video intro](Videos/RStudio_environ1.webm) to the RStudio environment 

## Some useful links 

  * For R programming questions, a wonderful (peer-reviewed) forum is http://stackoverflow.com/ (add the `[r]` label in the search box to limit the search to R related topics).
  * For statistical questions, search the http://stats.stackexchange.com forum (here too add the `[r]` label in the search box to limit the search to R related topics)
  * A very nice repository of R related blogs is http://R-bloggers.com (I check this daily!)
  * If you are on the Colby network, you can access the **Use R!**  online books series at http://link.springer.com/bookseries/6991
